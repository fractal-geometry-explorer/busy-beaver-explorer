# 1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_1RB0RD_0RB---

bbchallenge id 28035. One of the six-state holdouts whose halting from blank tape is open (group G11).

Family **G11-Y** (two counters ticking together, `1RB0LB_0RC0LD` and relatives): this machine is a disguised copy (E0 = 1RB, E1 = 0RD, F0 = 0RB): the same counters with the digits written differently, the same rhythm of left-end extensions, and E1 rare.

| state | read 0 | read 1 |
|---|---|---|
| A | 1RB | 0LB |
| B | 0RC | 0LD |
| C | 1LD | 1RE |
| D | 0LA | 0RF |
| E | 1RB | 0RD |
| F | 0RB | --- |

## What it does

The tape is, most of the time, `L · engine · R`. Every visit of the head to the engine (an *event*) adds 1 to two binary
counters, one on each side. In the reference machine `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_0RD1RF_0RC---`, `L` is in 4-cell blocks (`0101` = 1,
`0001` = 0, lowest digit next to the engine) and `R` has one cell per digit, three cells apart (cells 9, 12, 15, … right
of the head), lowest digit nearest the engine. Between some digits of `R` there are fixed stretches (junk) that the carries cross.

- **Left side: clockwork.** When `L` overflows the carry reaches the left end, the tape grows by two cells and `L`
  restarts. The busiest cell (the lowest digit of `L`) turns exactly 2^k times between consecutive left-end extensions, each power twice: 64, 64, 128, 128, …, 2^24
  (first 1.5·10^9 steps, `ymax.c`).
- **The junk.** The change counts per cell (`chg.c`: how often each cell changes between consecutive events over a
  whole period) halve from one digit to the next, with junk stretches between some digits. The junk is written when a
  carry reaches the end of the tape (at irregular event counts); how is not decoded.
- **Where it can halt.** Only in F reading 1; F is entered from D1 (0RF) only. After D1, used about 4·10^7 times in 10^9 steps, the head has read a 0 every time. The rare transition is E1 (306 uses in 10^9 steps), as in the reference machine, where in the reference machine E1 fires when a carry of the right counter reaches a digit for the first time since the last left-end visit: right after the visit at step 2,188,604 it fires at steps 2,188,675, 2,188,767, 2,188,882, 2,189,117, 2,189,592, 2,190,547, 2,192,462, three cells further right each time and after twice the wait each time, as a binary counter reaching new digits. It leads to D here, not F, so this machine halts only if an ordinary carry finds a 1 after D1.

The family: `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_0RD1RF_0RC---` (reference), `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_0RD1RB_0RC---` (the same run, checked cell for cell for
10^10 steps), `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_0RD0LC_0RC---`, `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_1RB0RD_0RB---`,
`1RB0LB_0RC0LF_1LD1RE_0LA0RB_0RD0RF_0LA---` (left-end extensions after 2^k events, each twice, within a few hundred
steps of each other), `1RB0LB_0RC0LE_1RD0RF_1LB1RB_0LA0RE_1RE---` and `1RB0LB_0RC0LE_1RD0RF_1LB1RB_0LA1RB_1RE---` (same
right part at the left-end visits, 3·2^k), and the mirror case `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RB_0RD1RF_1LA---`.

## Events, third round

Here E0 = 1RB, E1 = 0RD and F0 = 0RB (reference `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_0RD1RB_0RC---`: E0 = 0RD, E1 = 1RB, F0 = 0RC).
The head is in state A on cell 3 only in phase 1, and the tapes there are exactly the reference's events 2, 4, 6, …
(2,097,151 events compared, 3·10^8 steps): one event here is the reference's left increment and the following right
increment done in one pass (the head carries over the left counter, comes back through the engine and carries the
right counter). `lean/Events.lean` (8 theorems): the reference's left rule composed with each of its right rules,
for every size; the left carry takes 14n steps where the reference takes 12n. Coverage: 90.4% of the 524,287 events of
the first 10^8 steps (the uncovered ones are the reference's uncovered right events). Halting needs D1 followed by a
1, as in the reference.

## Status

Open. Lean, kernel only: the halting configurations and 10^4 steps (`lean/Blank.lean`), the sweeps of the run (`lean/Rules.lean`), the left-and-right increments in one pass, 8 theorems (`lean/Events.lean`). `native_decide`: 10^7 steps. C: no halt in
10^11 steps.

## Next steps

Decode what a carry writes when it reaches the end of the tape, so that the junk after each visit is a formula in the
counters; then decide whether a carry can ever find a 1 where it has always found a 0.

## Scripts

- `py/events.py` writes `lean/Events.lean` (`--coverage STEPS [SHOW]`: match every event of the run against the rules).
`py/rules.py` writes `lean/Rules.lean` (with `../1RB---_0LC0RB_1RA1LD_0RD1LE_1LF0LA_1LB0LE/py/g11rules.py`). The C
tools of the batch are in `../1RB---_0LC0RB_1RA1LD_0RD1LE_1LF0LA_1LB0LE/c/` (`gcc -O2 -o X X.c`): `ymax.c` (turns of
the busiest cell between end extensions), `chg.c` (change counts per cell between events), `usage.c` (transition
counts), `lockstep.c` (two machines side by side), `trlog.c` (every use of one transition), `longrun.c` (a long run).

## Related machines

Other holdouts of the list of 608 that are tied to this one. The comparison of tables is exact; everything about runs was checked on the first 10^7 steps of each machine and is an observation, not a proof (`holdouts/related.py`, `holdouts/related.json`).

**Same tapes at another pace (observed, not proved).** Leave the states aside and compare only the tape and the place of the head. Then a large part of the first 10^7 configurations of this machine are configurations of the machines below, in the same order and up to the end of the run. The steps at which they occur differ, the tables are not renamings of each other, and equal tapes with different states may be continued differently, so this does not tie the halting questions together.
