# 1RB0LB_0RC0LF_1LD1RE_0LA0RB_0RD0RF_0LA---

bbchallenge id 112145. One of the six-state holdouts whose halting from blank tape is open (group G11).

Family **G11-Y** (two counters ticking together, `1RB0LB_0RC0LD` and relatives): this machine is a disguised copy (B1 = 0LF with F0 = 0LA, so F reading 0 acts as D; D1 = 0RB; E1 = 0RF): the same left-end extensions to within a few hundred steps, and E1 rare.

| state | read 0 | read 1 |
|---|---|---|
| A | 1RB | 0LB |
| B | 0RC | 0LF |
| C | 1LD | 1RE |
| D | 0LA | 0RB |
| E | 0RD | 0RF |
| F | 0LA | --- |

## What it does

The tape is, most of the time, `L · engine · R`. Every visit of the head to the engine (an *event*) adds 1 to two binary
counters, one on each side. In the reference machine `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_0RD1RF_0RC---`, `L` is in 4-cell blocks (`0101` = 1,
`0001` = 0, lowest digit next to the engine) and `R` has one cell per digit, three cells apart (cells 9, 12, 15, … right
of the head), lowest digit nearest the engine. Between some digits of `R` there are fixed stretches (junk) that the carries cross.

- **Left side: clockwork.** When `L` overflows the carry reaches the left end, the tape grows by two cells and `L`
  restarts. The busiest cell (the lowest digit of `L`) turns exactly 2^k times between consecutive left-end extensions, each power twice: 64, 64, 128, 128, …, 2^24
  (first 1.5·10^9 steps, `ymax.c`).
- **The junk.** The change counts per cell (`chg.c`: how often each cell changes between consecutive events over a
  whole period) halve from one digit to the next, with junk stretches between some digits. The junk is written when a
  carry reaches the end of the tape (at irregular event counts); how is not decoded.
- **Where it can halt.** Only in F reading 1; F is entered from B1 (0LF) and E1 (0RF). After B1, used about 4·10^7 times in 10^9 steps, the head has read a 0 every time. E1 is the rare one: 306 uses in 10^9 steps, each followed by a 0, as in the reference machine, where in the reference machine E1 fires when a carry of the right counter reaches a digit for the first time since the last left-end visit: right after the visit at step 2,188,604 it fires at steps 2,188,675, 2,188,767, 2,188,882, 2,189,117, 2,189,592, 2,190,547, 2,192,462, three cells further right each time and after twice the wait each time, as a binary counter reaching new digits.

The family: `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_0RD1RF_0RC---` (reference), `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_0RD1RB_0RC---` (the same run, checked cell for cell for
10^10 steps), `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_0RD0LC_0RC---`, `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_1RB0RD_0RB---`,
`1RB0LB_0RC0LF_1LD1RE_0LA0RB_0RD0RF_0LA---` (left-end extensions after 2^k events, each twice, within a few hundred
steps of each other), `1RB0LB_0RC0LE_1RD0RF_1LB1RB_0LA0RE_1RE---` and `1RB0LB_0RC0LE_1RD0RF_1LB1RB_0LA1RB_1RE---` (same
right part at the left-end visits, 3·2^k), and the mirror case `1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RB_0RD1RF_1LA---`.

## Events, third round

The reference's event theorems (`../1RB0LB_0RC0LD_1LD1RE_0LA0RF_0RD1RB_0RC---/py/events.py`) prove here unchanged (`lean/Events.lean`,
10 theorems). The differences: B1 = 0LF with F0 = 0LA = D0 (B1 followed by a 0 is the reference's B1 followed by D0),
D1 = 0RB (the reference's D1 = 0RF followed by F0 = 0RC = B0 on a 0), and E1 = 0RF: `L E> 1 0 R` → `L 1 B> 0 R` in 3
steps (`y_e1_detour`) where the reference takes 1. So the tape at every event is the reference's (2,000,000 events
compared), 2 steps later per use of E1 (498 = 2 · 249 at 2.95·10^8 steps). Here F1 halts after B1 or E1: the machine
halts if a B1 or an E1 is ever followed by a 1 (in the reference's run, B1 and E1 have always been followed by a 0).

## Status

Open. Lean, kernel only: the halting configurations and 10^4 steps (`lean/Blank.lean`), the sweeps of the run (`lean/Rules.lean`), the increments of both counters and the junk crossings, the reference's 9 theorems plus the E1 detour (`lean/Events.lean`). `native_decide`: 10^7 steps. C: no halt in
10^11 steps.

## Next steps

Decode what a carry writes when it reaches the end of the tape, so that the junk after each visit is a formula in the
counters; then decide whether a carry can ever find a 1 where it has always found a 0.

## Scripts

- `py/events.py` writes `lean/Events.lean` (`--coverage STEPS [SHOW]`: match every event of the run against the rules).
`py/rules.py` writes `lean/Rules.lean` (with `../1RB---_0LC0RB_1RA1LD_0RD1LE_1LF0LA_1LB0LE/py/g11rules.py`). The C
tools of the batch are in `../1RB---_0LC0RB_1RA1LD_0RD1LE_1LF0LA_1LB0LE/c/` (`gcc -O2 -o X X.c`): `ymax.c` (turns of
the busiest cell between end extensions), `chg.c` (change counts per cell between events), `usage.c` (transition
counts), `lockstep.c` (two machines side by side), `trlog.c` (every use of one transition), `longrun.c` (a long run).

## Related machines

Other holdouts of the list of 608 that are tied to this one. The comparison of tables is exact; everything about runs was checked on the first 10^7 steps of each machine and is an observation, not a proof (`holdouts/related.py`, `holdouts/related.json`).

**Same tapes at another pace (observed, not proved).** Leave the states aside and compare only the tape and the place of the head. Then a large part of the first 10^7 configurations of this machine are configurations of the machines below, in the same order and up to the end of the run. The steps at which they occur differ, the tables are not renamings of each other, and equal tapes with different states may be continued differently, so this does not tie the halting questions together.
